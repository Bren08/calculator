### Day 2: July 07 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Styled the interface of the calculator, gave indentification attributes to the button elements in the html but JS is not playing ball with me right now! error reads: ';' expected. ts(1005)

**Thoughts:** JS is busting my... so time is up now and we shall try again tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 08 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved some JS issues I was having (syntax errors) so once we got shot of them, I got going again but didn't leave much time left within the hour.

**Thoughts:** A lot happier with how the JS is working now.. don't love it but also don't hae it... yet!

### Day 4: July 10 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day due to it being my birthday (that's allowed I'm sure) but got back on track after some problems arose, the JS seems ok now, added some logic to help along the operational buttons to tot up on the interface.

**Thoughts:** Happy Birthday to me!!
