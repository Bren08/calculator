### Day 2: July 07 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Styled the interface of the calculator, gave indentification attributes to the button elements in the html but JS is not playing ball with me right now! error reads: ';' expected. ts(1005)

**Thoughts:** JS is busting my... so time is up now and we shall try again tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 08 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved some JS issues I was having (syntax errors) so once we got shot of them, I got going again but didn't leave much time left within the hour.

**Thoughts:** A lot happier with how the JS is working now.. don't love it but also don't hae it... yet!
