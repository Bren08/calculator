**Thoughts:** And we're off....

### Day 2: July 07 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Styled the interface of the calculator, gave indentification attributes to the button elements in the html but JS is not playing ball with me right now! error reads: ';' expected. ts(1005)

**Thoughts:** JS is busting my... so time is up now and we shall try again tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 08 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Resolved some JS issues I was having (syntax errors) so once we got shot of them, I got going again but didn't leave much time left within the hour.

**Thoughts:** A lot happier with how the JS is working now.. don't love it but also don't hae it... yet!

### Day 4: July 10 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day due to it being my birthday (that's allowed I'm sure) but got back on track after some problems arose, the JS seems ok now, added some logic to help along the operational buttons to tot up on the interface.

**Thoughts:** Happy Birthday to me!!

### Day 5: July 11 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: It's mainly all JS now to finish off. Again ran into problems with JS and missing some vital functions to be fully operational.

**Thoughts:** Today was a good day, even if it didn't go as planned, I've learned to be more patient to see errors within code.

### Day 6: July 13 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished off the last bits of JS and now the calculator is fully operational and it's not broken.

**Thoughts:** First few days complete with the challenge, it's hard going to even get the hour in everday with other commitments, family, work etc, but I'm getting there (even if "Life" gets in the way). Trying my best to fit in the hour each day.
